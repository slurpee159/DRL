# HWâ€¯4â€‘1Â â€”Â NaiveÂ DQN on **Static Gridworld**

**Q1:** I executed `!python hw4_1_naive_dqn.py` in Colab and immediately saw `error: unrecognized arguments: -f â€¦kernelâ€‘xxxx.json`.
**A1:** That flag comes from Jupyter itself. I switched to *tolerant* parsing:

```python
args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()  # ignores unknown notebook flags
```

Pull the updated script and the error disappears.

**Q2:** The next run crashed with `AttributeError: 'Gridworld' object has no attribute 'observation'`.
**A2:** The original Gridworld isnâ€™t Gymâ€‘style, so I wrapped it:

```python
class GridEnvWrapper:
    def reset(self):
        self.raw.initGridStatic()
        return self._flatten_board()
    def step(self, a_idx):
        self.raw.makeMove({0:'u',1:'d',2:'l',3:'r'}[a_idx])
        r = self.raw.reward()
        done = r in {10,-10}
        return self._flatten_board(), r, done
```

This adds `reset()`, `step()`, `render()` and a 64â€‘dim oneâ€‘hot observation, solving the attribute error.

**Q3:** Training starts but early returns plunge to â€“50. Is that normal?
**A3:** Yes. With Îµâ‰ˆ1.0 the agent moves randomly, often falling into the pit (â€“10) many times per episode. As Îµ decays (*exponential with Ï„Â =Â 300*):

```python
eps = eps_end + (eps_start - eps_end) * math.exp(-steps / 300)
```

returns climb towards 0Â â€¦Â +4. Occasional negative spikes remain due to residual exploration and vanilla DQN instability.

\| **I ran `!python hw4_1_naive_dqn.py` in Colab and got**<br>`error: unrecognized arguments: -f â€¦kernelâ€‘xxxx.json`. | That flag is injected by Jupyter. I swapped `parse_args()` for `parse_known_args()` so unknown flags are ignored. Please pull the new script and rerun. |
\| **Now it stops at**<br>`AttributeError: 'Gridworld' object has no attribute 'observation'`. | The legacy environment lacked a Gymâ€‘like API. I wrapped it with `GridEnvWrapper`, adding `reset()`, `step()`, `render()`, and a flattened oneâ€‘hot observation. Updated script uploaded. |
\| **The code trains, but rewards plunge to â€“50 early on. Normal?** | Yes. At high Îµ (â‰ˆ1) the agent explores randomly, often falling into the pit (â€“10). As Îµ decays it learns and returns rise toward 0Â â€¦Â +4. Occasional dips remain due to exploration plus vanilla DQN instability. |
\| **Greedy evaluation shows 7 steps with totalÂ +4. Is that optimal?** | Exactly. Shortest safe path: 6 moves Ã— (â€“1) + terminal +10 = **+4**. Seven moves from `(0,3)` to `(0,0)` avoids the pit `(0,1)` and wall `(1,1)`. |
\| **So training is successful?** | Yesâ€”the Naive DQN baseline now works and can serve as a reference for Double/Dueling variants in later tasks. |

### 3Â |Â Results

* **Learning curve:** after \~200 episodes returns stabilise around 0Â â€“Â +4 with sporadic spikes below â€“20.
* **Greedy test:** agent reliably reaches the goal in **7 moves**, total reward **+4** (optimal).
* **Artifact:** `training_curve.png` shows the convergence trend (see Colab output).

### 4Â |Â Key Takeaways

1. **Replay Buffer + Target Network** are indispensableâ€”removing either caused divergence in early trials.
2. Proper Îµâ€‘decay balances exploration (discovering the path) and exploitation (refining Qâ€‘values).
3. A single hidden layer of 128 units already suffices for this tiny task; larger models did not help.
4. Negative outliers stem from residual exploration and Qâ€‘over/underâ€‘estimation typical of vanilla DQN.
